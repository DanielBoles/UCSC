Assignment: CS109 HW5
Collaboration: None
Time Spent: 6hrs

Within this assignment I created a small game of Hex (5x5). The game can be played with 0, 1, or 2 players. 
I wrote an algorithm from the ground up that finds a path through the game board. There are a few known bugs 
in my code and I should start by saying I did not complete the minimax assignment. I did however make a lot of 
progress on this assignment as a whole. I got a good ground work on the capability of the game and how to 
predictively and accurately move through the board. I need to work more on the assignment 6 or I will have the 
same result. Please grade what you can of the assignment and let me know if you have any comments.

Thanks.
