Within this assignment I learned a lot about how to access different libraries and implement graphs in C++. 
It took me a few days to get the code started, I am never good at starting without pseudo or starter code. I 
started by creating a graph using Adjacency List form. I got one graph working with 2 vertices and began creating 
user input. Since the assignment wants it to be capable of 50 vertices and different densities, I wrote a code 
that is compatible with any amount of vertices and edge density from 1-100% with any weight as well. I have it set 
to randomly create edges between two vertices with random weight range set by the user. This was the easy part. 
I was unable to get a working priority queue and shortest path. I needed more help with this assignment then I 
allowed myself and ran out of time working on it much more for the last couple days. I want to point out that 
my adjacency list works with the requirements but I do not have dijkstra's working for average paths. Hope the 
code is at least worth a couple points and style credit. 

Thanks.
