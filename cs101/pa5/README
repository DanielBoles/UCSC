Files for submission:

README
Makefile
List.c 
List.h 
Graph.c 
Graph.h 
GraphTest.c 
FindComponents.c

NOTE: I was unable to complete some part of Graph.c which lead to this not working.
This however was working mostly in1 but not GraphClient. I isolated one of my 
problem to the function copyGraph. Currently both FindComponent and GraphClient do not 
work completely. Please grade what segments work. Thank you.
